 WordPress theme used for [Revive Today](https://revive.today).

 The theme is a fork of [BlogSixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/blogsixteen/).

## Installation
This theme is currently not listed on the WordPress site. If you wish to install the theme, you can do so using two different methods.

### GitHub Auto-Updater
A wonderful plugin called [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) allows you to install and update plugins from GitHub repositories. Once installed, go to settings > GitHub Updater > Install Theme and paste in the URL of this GitHub Page.

### Manual Installation
You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/ReviveToday/Modernscape/releases) zip and manually upload it to your WordPress site. You can do so by downloading the latest modernscape.zip, then browsing to Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme.

## Supported Plugins
To comply with the [Acceptable Ads policy](https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads), the theme has a manual ad reference for the plugin [Advanced Ads](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/). The default setup places adverts underneath the article title, which violates the ad separation part of the policy. Instead, the theme has a header.php reference which will appear above the article title.

To use, browse to Advanced Ads > Placements > New Placement > Manual placement (looks like <?  ... ?> [...]) and add a new placement titled 'above-title'.
